			<p class="intro__dek">In the past decade, <strong>cryptocurrencies and blockchains</strong> have become increasingly significant in terms of technological <strong>innovation</strong> and potential <strong>socio-economic impact</strong>. However, due to the manner in
				which blockchain-based technologies operate, they run the <strong>risk</strong> of reproducing existing <strong>inequalities</strong>. The inequality in question here is that surrounding <strong>digital divide</strong></p>
			<p class="intro__dek">- the uneven distribution and development of information and communication technologies (ICT) from local areas to global communities -</p>
			<p class="intro__dek">and the global distribution of <strong>Bitcoin mining</strong></p>
			<p class="intro__dek">- a labor task facilitated by humans and machines in order to extract cryptocurrency rewards -</p>

					<p><span class="highlight-yellow">Bitcoin mining</span> is truly a global phenomena.<br><br> As we can see using data from Bitnodes, the distribution of miners around the world is highly concentrated in North America and Europe. These are parts of the
						world in which ICT infrastructure was first developed and most frequently updated with the most modern hardware and software techniques.</p>
				</div>
				<div class='step' data-step='1'>
					<p>This is largely due to how the Internet and its infrastructure was originally deployed.<br><br> Many of the <span class="highlight-red">major points of access</span> are located along the coast of North America and Europe as a result of early deployments
						and adoption of infrastructure that now constitutes the Internet.</p>
				</div>
				<div class='step' data-step='2'>
					<p>For example, the deployment of <span class="highlight-blue">submarine cables</span> as seen here was and is extremely expensive.<br><br> The nations and corporations that have funded the development of this infrastructure optimized connectivity from
						themselves to other wealthy areas of the world that were looking to “shrink” communications distance.<br><br> This means that citizens in these areas are optimally situated to enter, compete, and benefit from new blockchain-based technologies.</p>

		<p class="outro__dek">One of the primary points of contention with new technologies is the matter of <strong>who has access</strong> to them.</p>
		<p class="outro__dek">Despite the distributed nature of blockchain technologies, access remains <strong>an issue</strong> as those best located near existing ICT infrastructure are those <strong>who will ultimately benefit</strong> from their use.</p>
		<p class="outro__dek"><strong>Much has yet to be done</strong> in terms of design, scalability, and latency if blockchain technologies are to be considered revolutionary for everyone.</p>
