					<p>La- da- da- da- dah. Just be happy. Now let's put some happy little clouds in here. From all of us here, I want to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friends. If you've been in Alaska less than a year you're a Cheechako.</p>
					<p>What the devil. It just happens - whether or not you worried about it or tried to plan it. You can do anything here. So don't worry about it.</p>
					<p>There's not a thing in the world wrong with washing your brush. All you have to do is let your imagination go wild. You can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things in here. Just think about these things in your mind - then bring them
						into your world. Let your imagination be your guide.</p>

					<p>Trees grow however makes them happy. Let's give him a friend too. Everybody needs a friend. You don't have to be crazy to do this but it does help.</p>
					<p>I want everbody to be happy. That's what it's all about. Get tough with it, get strong. A happy cloud.</p>
					<p>Isn't that fantastic? You can just push a little tree out of your brush like that. I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most people. Have fun with it.</p>
				</div>
				<div class='step' data-step='3'>
					<p>Now we'll take the almighty fan brush. Mix your color marbly don't mix it dead. I'll go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent
						red. If there's two big trees invariably sooner or later there's gonna be a little tree.</p>
					<p>That is when you can experience true joy, when you have no fear. Let's have a nice tree right here. Let's put some happy little clouds in our world.</p>
